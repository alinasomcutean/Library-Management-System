# Library-Management-System
This is the Software Engineering semestrial project.

It is an web-app for a Library System designed using Java and Spring Framework for back-end and HTML and CSS for front-end.

In this app, there are three types of users: administrator, librarian and regular user. 

Administrator can do the following operations:
- CRUD on books;
- search a book after more criterias: title, author or subject.

- for librarian:
  - find who took a particular book;
  - find what books currently have a person;
  - collect fines from persons who returned the books later;
  - borrow a book for a reader;
